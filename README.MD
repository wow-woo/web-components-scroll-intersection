## Intersection observer API

- Browser
- scroll effect
- lazy-loading

### [x] Behavior differs on options

- all options are alright
- chrome, brave [good support]
- firefox [bad support][x]

### Consider not X-axis but Y-xis [caution]

- target must be within observer's viewport not only X-axis but also Y-axis.
