## Intersection observer API

- Browser
- scroll effect
- lazy-loading

### [x] Behavior differs on options

- chrome, brave [good support]
- [x] firefox [bad support]

### Consider not X-axis but Y-xis [notice]

- all options are alright on most browser
- target must be within observer's viewport not only X-axis but also Y-axis.
